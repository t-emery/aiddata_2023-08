## Agenda

::: incremental
1.  Working with the GCDF data as a new user: joys, pain points, and ideas for marginal improvements.
2.  `chinadevfin2` - an R package for working with the GCDF 2.0 dataset.
3.  Group discussion.

# 1. Working with the GCDF data as a new user

## Context

How I became a connoisseur of large international datasets...

::: incremental
1.  Private sector
2.  Policy research
3.  Teaching
:::

## Overall Assessment

The GCDF 2.0 is a well organized dataset with *A LOT* of amazing data. The methodology and variables are well documented. The pain points I've experienced working with it are common to most large datasets:

::: incremental
1.  Getting the data ready for analysis is time consuming.
2.  Country names are not presented in a standardized format.
:::

## Three Easy Improvements

You work hard to create these datasets. What are some easy-to-implement changes to enhance their use?

::: incremental
1.  Release the dataset as a `.csv` file in addition to the `.xlsx` to make it easier to import into data analysis software.
2.  Add country [ISO3C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) codes for recipient countries to make it easier to combine the GCFD data with complementary datasets.\
3.  Create a "cookbook" demonstrating simple examples of how users can use the data to gain insights, and answers to common challenges. This can ease adoption of the dataset.

# 2. Introducing the `chinadevfin2` R Package

## `chinadevfin2`

## Caveats

1.  So far, this is a personal project.
2.  It is a *minimum viable product.*
3.  It won't take too much effort to adapt this to the new GCDF 3.0 dataset.

## Let's Explore

1.  [`chinadevfin2` R package website](https://t-emery.github.io/chinadevfin2/)
2.  [Getting Started tutorial](https://t-emery.github.io/chinadevfin2/articles/getting_started.html)
3.  [A simple interactive web app built using `chinadevfin2`](https://tealinsights.shinyapps.io/gcdf2_explorer/)

# 3. Group Discussion
